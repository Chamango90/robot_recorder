This package can be used to record a ROS system for the web as a _three.js_ animation. The result can e.g. be displayed in gh-pages or converted to a GIF.

## Usecases

- Show a 3D demo of your ROS application
- Inspect failed CI test result(s)
- Visualize parameter studies

## How to use?

In order to reduce the recorded data it does not apply a fixed rate but keyframes.

1. "Automatic mode": By default the node records* as soon as it is started and saves data as soon as it is closed.  
    -> Set param `~manual` to `false`

1. "Manual mode": Control the tool via ROS services.  
    -> Set param `~manual` to `true`
    
    Available ROS services (private ns `~` is by default `robot_recorder/`):
    - `~preconfigure` (OPTIONAL): Start ROS subscribers and load `robot_description` param (Requires 2 secs).
    - `~start`: Preconfigures if not yet done and then starts recording*.
    - `~pause`: Pause and unpause the recording.
    - `~stop`: Stops the recording and saves it to the given file path (param `~output_file`)  
    ATTENTION: It will overwrite existing files!
    By default saved in the path `~.ros/` with a timestamped name.
    
*Once the recorder is started it will wait until the robot "moves" (new `tf` or `joint_states` msgs) before it starts the actual recording. Throttling by change (see _What can be recorded?_) is recommended.

By default the recorded `.json` file will be saved inside the `robot_recorder_core` package.


## What can be recorded?

1. `/joint_states` 

    This topic provides the changes of the robot joints and represents the **internal motion** of the robot. It can be throttled by [rate][1] and by [change][2] to reduce the recorded keyframes.
  
1. `/tf`

    This topic should be used to get the **external motion** of the robot with respect to a fixed world/map. It can be throttled by [change][3] to reduce the recorded keyframes. The referenced node considers by default only the tf change between the frames `map` <--> `base_link`.
  
## Which output-format is used?

The recorded robot movements are saved as animation of the `JSON Object format` ([three.js example][4]) which can be utilized by the three.js [animation system][5].

## How is the URDF visualized in the three.js scene?

With the `urdf-loader` tool: https://github.com/gkjohnson/urdf-loaders

## How to add animations and a GIF converter?

With the `urdf-animation` tool, which wraps the `urdf-loader`: https://github.com/ipa-jfh/urdf-animation
